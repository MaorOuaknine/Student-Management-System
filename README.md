# Student-Management-System
full-stack web application that allows users to manage student records. It provides a simple interface for adding, viewing, and deleting student information. The application is built using Spring Boot for the backend, which handles RESTful API endpoints and database interactions, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, providing a user-friendly experience. The system uses Spring Data JPA to interact with a relational database (such as MySQL) to store and manage student data.

This project demonstrates full-stack development, REST API integration, and basic CRUD operations with a database. It is ideal for those looking to learn more about backend development with Spring Boot and frontend development using simple web technologies.
